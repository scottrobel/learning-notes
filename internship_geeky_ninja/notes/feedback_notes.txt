    making page responsive
      reduce font-size for smaller screen sizes 
      reduced number of columns depending on screen width
      find where elements collide and change rows to columns
        -separating row elements considering how you would transform them to columns
      removed grid row number
      rows are dynamically created
        added "main" container
      for sizing and responsivness
      sized main container
        with a "max-width"
          max-width: 1200px;
          the max width is the same as
          the width that it changes to the mobile layout at
          max-width will allow the content to shrink on
          smaller displays while at not getting stretched out on larger displays
        and margin
          adding a top margin of 145px to make room for the navbar
          adding auto margins on both sidesto center the content
          adding an @media attribute to chnage the margins when the width of the screen changes
          margin: 145px auto 0 auto;
          @media only screen and (max-width: 1200px)
            .main[data-v-d16d3411] {
                margin: 0 auto 0 auto;
            }
          }
      fix nav bar
