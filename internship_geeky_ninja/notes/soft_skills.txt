motivation
    Remember that I chose to volunteer.
    They are paying to train me.
    I am paying for more for an education at school that will grant me far less options.
    The year may suck but it will forever change my life
    Once I transfer/job hop I will be able to afford a place to live and tuition + have better options
    for what school I will goto
    Main rule is Do not take up other peoples time!
    I will get kicked off the team if I do this
    I am paired up with Daniel
I started working at TGN on october 25 (for the sake of other jobs)
for personal sake, I started december 6th
