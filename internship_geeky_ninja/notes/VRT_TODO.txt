Daily Script - No hard deadline
  Actually sort of. Not writing solidity, but interacting with it a bit. You did that script to pull....was it pollen and/or helium data for Andrew's dashboard didn't you?
  We're going to be creating something sort of like that for VRT.
  In a nutshell it will consist of:
  1. Look at event logs and record every address that stakes/modifies, save it into a Supabase table
    passive implemtnation
      to get event logs
      await contract.getPastEvents('MyEvent', {fromBlock: 0})
      get contract address
  2. Given a max number of transactions per day, run a loop and call claimRewards(the_address) on whichever address hasn't been claimed in the longest.
  Number 3 will require dealing with having a wallet loaded and the ability to write transactions, not just read web3 data.
  It's not solidity work, but it's something that we'll be doing. Either Jasper, Daniel, or you, or a collaboration. We have examples of these in the wHNT repo as well.
  Can you do this while I get to the rewards redemption?
  (FYI you'll need to modify the portfolio section in the portfolio.vue file.)
Done
  Withdraw feature = Unknown put present deadline
    8. New feature: Withdraw feature, header update:
    Change the information boxes into a
      3 column layout like above,
      make them a bit taller,
      use a larger font.
    Place claim button in a separate row as a 2 column layout, with a "Withdraw Stake" button to the right, this button will be gray/disabled for now.  
    - Future logic will call the withdraw() function, but only be available if the user's stake time == 0. (We have 30 days after contracts/DApp goes live before this needs to be live.
  show connect wallet button instead of Approve $VRT
